  * Regression problem - housing price example. We are trying to predict a continouse output value (namely house price).
  * Classification problem - Breast Cancer problem. Here we are trying to predict a discrete value based on one or more attributes.(malignant =Y/N).
   * Support Vector Machine - Supports an infinite number of attributes to make the prediction.
